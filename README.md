# MultiHealthSensors_ECG_BODYTEMP
An Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) Project. This repository contains the development of the android application that has integrated the fall detection sub-system, body temperature sensor and ECG/HeartRate sensor. The multi-function IoMT system my team and I are developing aims to relieve the strain on the public healthcare system in supporting an increasingly aged population through the provision of cost-effective health monitoring.
